## graph
*   graph = node + edges
*   dfs
    * uses stack
    * easy to implement
*   bfs
    * uses queue 
    * no recursive approach
    * used in shortest path algorithm
*   union find
    * finds components (nodes) are connected
*   directed graph => cache is not required
*   undirected graph => cache is required to avoid infinite loop
