Graph / Scheduling (Kubernetes-like scheduling, dependencies)

- Course Schedule (LC 207) â†’ Pod scheduling / dependency graph (topological sort)
- Course Schedule II (LC 210) â†’ Find valid execution order for jobs/services
- Alien Dictionary (LC 269) â†’ Ordering rules (similar to orchestrator dependencies)

Concurrency / Message Queues

- Print in Order (LC 1114) â†’ Thread synchronization basics
- Print FooBar Alternately (LC 1115) â†’ Producer-consumer patterns
- Building H2O (LC 1117) â†’ Semaphore/barrier synchronization

ðŸ‘‰ These test multithreading skills, useful for message queues & orchestrators.

System / Resource Allocation

- Meeting Rooms II (LC 253) â†’ Similar to allocating containers to nodes (like Kubernetes scheduler)
- Task Scheduler (LC 621) â†’ Job scheduling with cooldown â†’ maps to workload placement across cloud nodes

Storage / Networking

- LRU Cache (LC 146) â†’ Caching layer for services / cloud infra
- LFU Cache (LC 460) â†’ Storage optimization / eviction strategies
- Design In-Memory File System (LC 588) â†’ Maps to storage APIs (ONTAP, file systems)

Backend / API Simulation
- Design Hit Counter (LC 362) â†’ Log aggregation (queries on recent data)
- Logger Rate Limiter (LC 359) â†’ Streaming logs & throttling requests

âœ… Suggested 3 Problem Focus (Most Relevant)

If you only have limited prep time, Iâ€™d recommend:

- Course Schedule II (LC 210) â†’ Kubernetes pod/job scheduling (dependencies).
- Task Scheduler (LC 621) â†’ Resource allocation across nodes/cloud.
- LRU Cache (LC 146) â†’ Storage + caching optimization.
