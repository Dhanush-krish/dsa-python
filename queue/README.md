### Queue

=> Fist In First Out
=> deque = **double ended queue**

```
Deques are sequence-like data types designed as a generalization of stacks and queues.
They support memory-efficient and fast append and pop operations on both ends of the data structure (10 times faster approx)
deques are implemented as a doubly linked list
```
