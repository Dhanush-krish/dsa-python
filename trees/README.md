### Tree
    1.Tree -> A non linear data structure
    2.Root Node -> Node with no parent
    3.Edge -> line connecting parent and child node
    4.Leaf Node -> Node with no children
    5.Siblings -> child node with same parent


### Tree Traversal
*   Pre-order  => root,left,right  => stack
*   In-order   => left,root,right  => stack
*   Post-order => left,right,root  => queue
